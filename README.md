# Project architect: Mortar
Mortar is the template engine in Architect.
It provides a simple syntax to perform actions such as including a file, getting a \_GET variable or just displaying stuff, with very short instructions.

_it's not obligatory but strongly recommended that you put your mortar directory outside of the user's reach, and use custom directories for anything public. .htaccess files are provided but may not be enough!_
